# Next Step: Push Commits to Fix Build

## Ready to Push

You have **2 commits** ready that will fix the Vercel build error:

```
53fc88a - chore: remove remaining Clerk files and clean up
98ac002 - fix: update pnpm-lock.yaml after Clerk to Stack Auth migration
```

## Push Command

Run this command to push your fixes:

```bash
git push origin master
```

## What Will Happen

1. ✅ Commits pushed to GitHub
2. ✅ Vercel automatically detects new commits
3. ✅ Starts new deployment with fixed lockfile
4. ✅ Build should succeed!

## Execute Push Now?

If you want to proceed, the command is ready. Just run:

```bash
git push origin master
```

Or I can help you verify everything is ready first.
